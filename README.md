# A Partial Extract of revctrl.org

In recent years the `revctrl.org` wiki has fallen victim to spam,
making it hard to find the valuable content that still resides there.
This is my first-pass attempt at extracting what remains of value.

Produced partly by hand, partly using the `pull` script in this
directory.

The page contents were downloaded on the 12th July 2012.

I have not yet been through the pages removing the spam links. Once
that's done, perhaps I'll make a PDF or a TiddlyWiki of the content or
something.
